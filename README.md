# guessing-game-using-js
#this is a game made just with js.
# rules
#1- you first enter the maximum number that you can think of!
#2- then a random number is generated in your console.
#3- your task is to guess the random number in the least number of guesses.
#4- if your guess is higher than the number generated then it will prompt that the guess it too high... make a lower guess
#- and if your guess is lower than the nnumber generated than it will prompt that the guess is too low... make a higher guess.
#5- when the guess is right then the console will print the amount of guesses it took you to reach the random number generated.
